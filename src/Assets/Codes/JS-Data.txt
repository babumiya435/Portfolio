Storage: Variables provide a way to store and manipulate data. They allow you to assign values and reference them later in your code. For example:

let x = 5;

Data Manipulation: Variables can hold different types of data, including numbers, strings, objects, arrays, etc. You can perform operations and manipulate the stored data using variables.
let name = "John";
let age = 30;
let fullName = name + " Doe";

Scope: Variables have a scope, which defines where in your code they are accessible. This helps in organizing and managing the flow of your program. JavaScript has function scope and block scope variables.
// Function scope
function greet() {
    let message = "Hello";
    console.log(message);
}
greet();
// console.log(message); // Error: message is not defined outside the function scope

// Block scope (ES6+)
if (true) {
    let x = 10;
    console.log(x); // 10
}
// console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined outside the block scope

Reusability: Variables allow you to reuse values throughout your code, reducing redundancy and making your code more maintainable.

let radius = 5;
let area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
console.log(area);

radius = 10; // Reassigning variable value
area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
console.log(area);

Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning you can assign values of any type to a variable without specifying its type explicitly. This flexibility allows for easier development and code maintenance.

let message = "Hello";
message = 10; // Valid, but may lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly
