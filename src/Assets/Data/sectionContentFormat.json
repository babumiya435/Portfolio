(Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)",
                    "JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.",
                    "JavaScript (JS) is a computer programming language used to make websites and applications dynamic and interactive.",
                    "It’s unique because it can run directly in your browser, not just on a server.",
                    "Along with hypertext markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS), JavaScript is one of the most commonly used programming languages of the internet.",
                    "In fact, 98.4% of all websites use JavaScript as of March 2023.",
                    "Think of these coding languages as the components of a house: HTML is the foundation of the house. It provides the basic layout, structure, and content of a website. CSS is the interior design. It provides design, fonts, colors, effects, and other visual elements. JavaScript is the electrical and plumbing systems. JS brings dynamism and interactivity to the website. For example, pop-ups, animations, video and social media embeds, drop-down menus, and many other website components are created using JavaScript.",
                    "JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.",
                    "JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.",
                    "JavaScript is a programming language that developers use to make interactive webpages. From refreshing social media feeds to displaying animations and interactive maps, JavaScript functions can improve a website's user experience. As a client-side scripting language, it is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. For example, when browsing the internet, anytime you see an image carousel, a click-to-show dropdown menu, or dynamically changing element colors on a webpage, you see the effects of JavaScript."
