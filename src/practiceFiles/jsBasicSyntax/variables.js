// "-----------Variables------------"


// Why Variabes are needed?
//Drawbacks(Without variable name):
// Usages(With variable):
// use case1 : want to use emloyee salary component 20000 value in my code at 100000000 places.

// traditional/basic way is : use 123456789 where ever it is required by directly copying.

var salary = 20000;
console.log("Employee Salary per month :",salary); // we can call or update the value with its variable name whenever we want to.
