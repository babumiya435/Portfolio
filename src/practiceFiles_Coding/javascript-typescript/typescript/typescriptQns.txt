2. Declaring variables with let, const, and var.

3. Type annotations and type inference.

4. Functions: Declaring functions with parameters and return types.

5. Optional and default parameters.

6. Arrow functions and their scoping rules.

7. Arrays and Tuples: Declaring arrays and their types.

8. Working with array methods and generics.

9. Understanding tuples and their usage.

10. Interfaces: Defining custom types with interfaces.

11. Optional properties and readonly properties.

12. Extending interfaces and intersection types.
